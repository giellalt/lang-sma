# Adjective stems

This is one of two parallel files containing adjective stems.
The files represent two alternative interpretation of the same data
(South Saami adjectives).
This file is used for dictionary and icall applications, the alternative file
*adjectives.lexc* is used for spellchecking.
This file is compiled by in
langs/sma giving the command *.configure --with-oahpa*
before compiling. The other file (adjectives.lexc) is compiled by default.
