      <title>Background information on the Southern Sami project</title>

      <p>The original Moshagen and Trosterud files are found at Lingsoft (in the sms directory there). They wrote an article on that parser, cf. the link below. Later, they received some comments from Lauri Karttunen that they (at some point) will incorporate in the article. The present sms parser is based upon Karttunen's critique. Contrary to the original version, it is able to generate forms as well as analysing them. As part of the evaluation of Karttunen's comments, the southern Sámi lexicon has been transformed from Lingsoft format to Xerox format.</p>

      <p>The article, , <a href="http://giellatekno.uit.no/sms-article.htm">A Two-level Parser for Southern Sámi</a>, is the most complete documentation of the Southern Sámi parser.</p>
