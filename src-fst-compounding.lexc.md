Prefixing and compounding
=========================

## Lexicon `Prefixes`

It contains only one entry:
- `Noerhte- ProperNoun ;`

## Lexicon `R`

This lexicon is the main entry for regular compounding.
All entries NOT requiring a hyphen should point to it. 

The whole content of it is a list of flag diacritics to control compounding.

After the flags, we continue to the `Rreal ;` lexicon, for the real compounding action.

It should be noted that some of the flags above require a corresponding flag in the lexicon `ENDLEX` to work properly. 

## Lexicon `Rreal`

This is where the actual compounding happens.
