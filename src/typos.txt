# This file contains common typos and their corrections separated by

# leif<tab>feil
# Corrections that consist of two or more parts are not splitted
# further in the preprocessor, because there is no way of knowing
# whether the token is multipart expression or not.
# Beware of removing sentence delimiters (.!?) in correction, since
# they may indicate sentence boundaries.
