# accented letters
# if the keyboard does not allow the accented letters comfortably,
# then some ad hoc conventions are used;
# i.e. these may be used many times inside a word
[
{ä} -> {æ}::1 , # Precomposed
{ä} -> {æ}::1 , # Combining diaeresis
{ø} -> {ö}::1 , 
{i} -> {ï}::1 ,
{ï} -> {i}::1 , # hyper correct
{YY} -> {öö}::1
