        <title>Umlaut errors</title>
        <p>jaevrie pl Acc</p>
        <p>claims jeevride should be jaevride</p>

          <title>Trouble recognising ie...ie nouns</title>
          <p>It seems it does not recognise ..ie..ie nouns. bielkie, biehkie, etc. Others work, e.g. jiekie !!??</p>
          <p>The error could lie in the different encoding in the lexicon, cf. below. Perhaps we should have had &quot;bE1hkI2&quot;, patterning with &quot;jiekie&quot;.</p>
          <source>jiekie:jE1kI2 N_IE;
biehkie:bI1hkI2 N_IE;
biejjie:bI1jjI2 N_IE;
bielie:bI1lI2 N_IE;
</source>

          <title>Generating the illative</title>
          <p>The generator gives us two illative suffixes for both bi- and trisyllables, in stead of the intended distribution. Thus, it generates both 'daktarasse' and '*daktarase', both 'maanese' and '*maanasse' (sic! note the errouneous -a- as well), both 'nï¿½jtese' and '*nï¿½jtasse'.</p>

          <title>Final -e missing in inessive</title>
          <p>The system gives inessives without the final -e. The maana nouns also lose their a/e alternation in the stem vowel.</p>

          <title>Errors in the 2nd person personal pronoun</title>
          <p>Have a look at the -nn- vs, -tn- alternation, it seems to be not ok.</p>
