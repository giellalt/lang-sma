            <title>The nouns</title>
            <p>The noun stems are stored in <code>gt/sma/noun-sma-lex.txt</code>, whereas the morphology is found in
            <code>gt/sma/sma-lex.txt</code>. It was made by converting the original Moshagen / Trosterud sma lexicon to
            the Xerox format. The lexical rules are taken from Karttunen's alternative formulation of our file. His
            original is found in the archive of original files (Contact Trond for reference, if needed).</p>
            <p>The nouns are divided into three stem classes, the N_IE nouns (gåetie, etc.), the N_OE nouns (bearkoe,
            etc) and the N_OTHER nouns (all other ones, bi- and trisyllabic alike).</p>
            <p>The case forms fall in three different groups: Forms unique to each of the three stem classes (listed
            under each sublexicon), forms with -j- in the N_OE class and -i- in the other ones (with separate i- and j-
            sublexica and a common suffix lexicon), and forms common to all stem classes (covered in a common
            continuation lexicon).</p>
            <p>Here is a list of the lexica (to be documented)</p>

            <title>The adjectives</title>
            <p>The continuation lexica are built on the following convention:</p>
            <p><code>attrsuffix_PREDSUFFIX_STEMTYPECOMPTYPE</code></p>
            <p>A letter C in the beginning of the suffix marks consonant. There may be more than one
            suffix both for attr and PRED, thereby the difference small/capital letters. Example:</p>
            <p><code>faelskies+CmpN/SgN+CmpN/SgG+CmpN/PlG:faelsk ies_IES_IE_EVEN</code></p>
<p>This is an even-syllabic adjective, with -ies attributive and -ies or -ie in predicative. Since
nothing is said about comparative forms, it has normal comparative and superlative inflection.</p>

            <title>The verbs</title>
            <p>The auxiliary <em>lea</em> and the negative verbs have been added. These verbs are irregular, and have
            thus been added without the use of any morphophonological processes.</p>

            <title>The adpositions and prepositions</title>
            <p>The adpositions in Bergsland's grammar have been listed, in two groups, pure postpositions and combined
            pre/postpositions (named "adpositions"). Other adpositions ahve been added.</p>
