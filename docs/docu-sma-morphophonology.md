South Saami morphophonological processes
========================================

Overview
--------

Below is a list of the phenomena that need to be accounted for:

-   [Umlaut](#Umlaut)
    -   [Umlaut table](#Table1)
-   [Vowel reduction](#VowelRed)
-   [Consonant simplification](#ConsSimp)
-   [Resyllabification](#Resyll)
-   [Stem type shift due to derivation](#StemShift)

The following is a list of contexts for the above phenomenon:

-   Regular nominal inflection
-   Possessive suffixes
-   Verbal inflection
-   Derivational suffixes

Further description of each phenomenon is given in the following
sections.

[Umlaut](#Top)
--------------

-   ****Location:** :**  
    First syllable in word, possibly in foot (needs to be further
    investigated)
-   ****Context:** :**  
    When the following syllable is reduced (as the second vowel in a
    three-syllable foot), it causes Umlaut of the first syllable
-   ****Restrictions:** :**  
    - Only nouns ending in -ie (obligatory) and -oe (optional, not all
    such words);  
    - Possessive inflection (needs further investigation);  
    - Only verbs of class I, II and IV (double check this, Bergsland
    could be incomplete);  
    - Many derivational endings (needs further investigation)  
    - Attribute forms of nominals

In the following table, all Umlaut rows are listed. The first syllable
vowel (the "Umlauted" one) can belong to one of seven sets, the vowel of
the following syllable (the "Umlauting" one) can be one of six. The core
Umlaut table is as found in Bergsland 1994: Sydsamisk grammatikk (page
32), the additional info about use is mine.

Note that the table is simplifying the facts. The different e's in the
context for R4-R6 is not further specified, nor is the fact that the
other Umlauting vowels might be full (as listed) or reduced due to the
addition of another syllable.

### Examples

Below is listed all the rows R1 to R6, together with where we find the
Umlauting ending in question, either reduced or fully, and examples of
the Umlaut process

#### R1 (-ie)

-   ****Full form:** :**  
    -ie
-   ****Reduced form:** :**  
    -e-
-   ****Found/used in:** :**  
    -   ****Nouns ending in -ie**  
        some of the cases, including nom. sg. & pl.:**  
        klihtie (C1), mehkie (C2), kruhpie (C3), mielhkie (C4), jaevrie
        (C5), getie (C6), njuenie (C7)
    -   ****Attributive form in -ies**  
        this category seems to cut across other categories:**  
        servies (&gt;sarva) (C2), gunkies (&gt;gnka) (C3), faelies
        (&gt;faala) (C5),
    -   ****Short forms of nouns (nominals?)**  
        not all such short forms cause umlaut, probably depends on the
        underlying vowel(?):**  
        dektier (&gt;daktere) (C2) - this is the only documented short
        form with Umlaut, and as the paradigm of 'daktere' clearly
        shows, the underlying vowel of the second syllable has to be 'a'
        (daktere &gt; daktarasse (ILL)); thus, it looks more like a case
        of lexical variants than real Umlaut

#### R2 (-a)

-   ****Full form:** :**  
    -a (long)
-   ****Reduced form:** :**  
    -e-
-   ****Found/used in:** :**  
    -   ****Nouns ending in -a** :**  
        mssa (C1), \*lantja, sarva (C2), krvna, gnka (C3), bearka (C4),
        maana, faala (C5), bara, bala (C6), buala (C7)  
        nouns belonging to this group do not undergo Umlaut during the
        course of inflection, but the root vowel adheres to the Umlaut
        table, such that there will not be any nouns with a root vowel
        other than those allowed in the Umlaut table (this is for the
        moment only a (likely) hypothesis, needs to be verified); but
        some of these words *do* have an attributive form ending in
        -ies, which causes Umlaut according to R1.
    -   ****Ill. Sg. for nouns ending in -ie** :**  
        (examples)
    -   ****3. Sg. Pres. for verbs on -ie-** :**  
        (examples)

Notes: R2 and R3 are almost completely identical (the only difference
can't really be verified, according to Bergsland 1994), the only
difference being the ending. But with a tendency for a geographical
distribution: the -a forms (R2) is more used in the south (marked with a
star '\*' in the dictionary Bergsland & Mattsson Magga 1993), the -oe
forms are unmarked. Additionally, there seems to be a tendency to blend
C2 and C3 for these two rows, such that one often finds several variants
of the same word, occupying one of the four places in the matrix
C2-C3,R2-R3 (the place R2C3 seems to be least used?).

#### R3 (-oe)

-   ****Full form:** :**  
    -oe
-   ****Reduced form:** :**  
    -o-, -e-
-   ****Found/used in:** :**

        mssoe (C1), slampoe (C2), krvnoe (C3), bearkoe (C4), aaltoe
        (C5), baloe (C6), (ingen dme p C7)
-   ****full form:** :**  
-   ****full form:** :**

    -oe
-   ****Reduced form:** :**  
    -o-, -e-

    -o-, -e-
