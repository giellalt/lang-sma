Most important/urgent:

URGENT 827	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	VGen - same analysis as in sme and smj (ie compatible tags) - +VGen not defined as multichar in sma, Thomas has added
URGENT 830	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	+Ine and +Ela +Attr - new tag combo, Tomi will add
URGENT 831	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	gellie not recognized - gellie added as pron lately, probably fixed, but needs testing
URGENT 845	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	compounds with Pl+Gen in second part Sg+Gen - the parallell cases in sme/smj are disguised by homoforms, but Tomi knows what the problem is now
URGENT 870	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	Default compounding: in sma it should be Sg+Nom & Sg+Gen: Sg+Gen in first part 

Second most important/urgent:

2URGENT 805	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	Nouns+Acronyms
2URGENT 889	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	number+case - added in analyser, but not found in the latest speller lexicon
2URGENT 890	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	proper nouns does not compound - there is a bug in the analyser, they are not analysed there either. Fix analyser first, then reevaluate. Still, Londonprosjektem is not accepteb by the speller, although it is analysed
2URGENT 892	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	noun+Acro without hyphen
2URGENT 893	thomas.omma@samediggi.	wowels in compound - how should we resolve this? - a#aa & e#ee <- PLX solution: treat them as proper nouns, acronyms, numbers etc.
2URGENT 894	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	hyphens or not in compounds - yes, we want them for all words in all langs, but with penalties on the suggs
2URGENT 902	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	prefixes not working - prefixes under an unknown lexicon name for the PLX conversion routine: Tomi to look for more lexicons, Thomas to move some entries

The least urgent of the urgent bugs:

826	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	gæhtsani
834	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	collective numerals - Thomas changed the tags, probably fixed now. Retest after next speller
837	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	noun+adjective compounds
846	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	non existent words accepted
869	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	sub-marked entries accepted by speller
891	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	millijovne is not recognized

Regular bugs, mostly not sma-specific:

595	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no		prefix+name as split comp without hyphen
619	thomas.omma@samediggi.n		numerals and pronouns to NAMÁK and SASJ fails
621	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		hyphen-suggestions resulting in double hyphen
629	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    a taking part of compound
634	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		Prop gen + hyphen + Prop gen
641	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    numeral+noun compounds
644	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    cased numeral+numeral compounds
647	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    numerals+NOUN
648	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		unmotivated suggestions with numeral+noun
652	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		UPPERCASE-typos only get acronym-suggestions
711	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    numeral compounds and cases
785	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    does not recognize alphabet-abbr+noun
802	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		multi word proper nouns
803	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    FINJU-/VINJU- words accepted single-handed


Proper nouns vs. common nouns: we misused an already existing set of PLX flags. The following works:

give all Proper Nouns (names etc.) PLX TAG "NeP" instead of "N" (= Noun with subclass 'e' and flag P)
add an A flag to every (Proper or common) Noun that can be a left part (or even to all Nouns)
Example: if lexicon contains:

land    NR
Lapland NePR
davvi   NAL
Davvi-- NePAL    // NB: PLX uses two minuses to encode 1 hard hyphen, which is ugly as well as problematic.

The following compounds are now recognized:

Davvi-Lapland
davviland

but not:

davviLapland
Davvi-land
