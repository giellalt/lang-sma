URGENT 827	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	VGen - same analysis as in sme and smj (ie compatible tags) - +VGen not defined as multichar in sma, Thomas has added
URGENT 830	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	+Ine and +Ela +Attr - new tag combo, Tomi will add
URGENT 831	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	gellie not recognized - gellie added as pron lately, probably fixed, but needs testing
URGENT 845	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	compounds with Pl+Gen in second part Sg+Gen - the parallell cases in sme/smj are disguised by homoforms, but Tomi knows what the problem is now
URGENT 870	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	Default compounding: in sma it should be Sg+Nom & Sg+Gen: Sg+Gen in first part 

2URGENT 894	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	hyphens or not in compounds - yes, we want them for all words in all langs, but with penalties on the suggs

2URGENT 902	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	prefixes not working - prefixes under an unknown lexicon name for the PLX conversion routine: Tomi to look for more lexicons, Thomas to move some entries
2URGENT 893	thomas.omma@samediggi.	wowels in compound - how should we resolve this? - a#aa & e#ee <- PLX solution: treat them as proper nouns, acronyms, numbers etc.
2URGENT 890	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	proper nouns does not compound - there is a bug in the analyser, they are not analysed there either. Fix analyser first, then reevaluate. Still, Londonprosjektem is not accepteb by the speller, although it is analysed

Proper nouns vs. common nouns: we misused an already existing set of PLX flags. The following works:

give all Proper Nouns (names etc.) PLX TAG "NeP" instead of "N" (= Noun with subclass 'e' and flag P)
add an A flag to every (Proper or common) Noun that can be a left part (or even to all Nouns)
Example: if lexicon contains:

land    NR
Lapland NePR
davvi   NAL
Davvi-- NePAL    // NB: PLX uses two minuses to encode 1 hard hyphen, which is ugly as well as problematic.

The following compounds are now recognized:

Davvi-Lapland
davviland

but not:

davviLapland
Davvi-land
