Most important/urgent:

I WANT THIS UP: Hmm, is it not working? we want penalties for hyphens, they should not be suggested
URGENT 894	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	hyphens or not in compounds - yes, we want them for all words in all langs, but with penalties on the suggs - recompile with penalty on hyphen
URGENT 805	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	Nouns+Acronyms - still broken, Tomi is working on it
URGENT 892	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	noun+Acro without hyphen - duplicate of 805, broken
URGENT 893	thomas.omma@samediggi.	wowels in compound - how should we resolve this? - a#aa & e#ee - still broken, see 805

Second most important/urgent:
2URGENT 889	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	number+case - fixed in sma, broken in sme & smj
2URGENT 831	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	gellie not recognized - gellie added as pron lately - pronoun is ok, numeral is not

The least urgent of the urgent bugs:

834	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	collective numerals - Thomas changed the tags, probably fixed now. Retest after next speller
837	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	noun+adjective compounds
891	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	millijovne is not recognized - duplicate of 831 (Numeral not included)

Regular bugs, mostly not sma-specific:

595	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no		prefix+name as split comp without hyphen
619	thomas.omma@samediggi.n		numerals and pronouns to NAMÁK and SASJ fails
621	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		hyphen-suggestions resulting in double hyphen
629	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    a taking part of compound
634	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		Prop gen + hyphen + Prop gen
641	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    numeral+noun compounds
644	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    cased numeral+numeral compounds
647	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    numerals+NOUN
648	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		unmotivated suggestions with numeral+noun
652	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		UPPERCASE-typos only get acronym-suggestions
711	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    numeral compounds and cases
785	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    does not recognize alphabet-abbr+noun
802	sjur.moshagen@samediggi		multi word proper nouns
803	tomi.pieski@hum.uit.no	    FINJU-/VINJU- words accepted single-handed

Tomi's task list:
1. recompile speller lexicon with hyphen penalty, redistribrute installer
2. fix the hyphenated compounds bug (e-ee, noun+acro bug)
3. fix the acro hyphen bug (NRK-nïejte bug)

Proper nouns vs. common nouns: we misused an already existing set of PLX flags. The following works:

give all Proper Nouns (names etc.) PLX TAG "NeP" instead of "N" (= Noun with subclass 'e' and flag P)
add an A flag to every (Proper or common) Noun that can be a left part (or even to all Nouns)
Example: if lexicon contains:

land    NR
Lapland NePR
davvi   NAL
Davvi-- NePAL    // NB: PLX uses two minuses to encode 1 hard hyphen, which is ugly as well as problematic.

The following compounds are now recognized:

Davvi-Lapland
davviland

but not:

davviLapland
Davvi-land
